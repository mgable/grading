- After running Grunt serve, a new browser window should spawn with the test runner

6) open file test/scripts/problem_3.js

- Every save will refresh the test runner

7) write function which pass all tests

Please commit your files and email me back about two things:

1)	How did the test install (steps 1-5)?
